Authentication and Authorization using postman 
Postman is a popular tool that allows you to send HTTP requests and inspect responses. Below, I'll guide you through the process of testing a Spring Boot REST API using Postman. 
1. Start Your Spring Boot Application:
Make sure your Spring Boot application is running. If it's not already running, you can start it by running your main application class.
2. Open Postman:
If you don't have Postman installed, you can download it from https://www.postman.com/ and install it. 
3. Create a Request:
Open Postman and create a new request by clicking the "New" button in the top left corner. Give your request a name and save it in a collection if you wish.
4. Set the Request Method and URL:
Choose the HTTP method for your request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). Enter the URL of the endpoint you want to test. For example, if your Spring Boot application is running on http://localhost:8080 and you have a /users endpoint, your URL would be
http://localhost:8080/users.
5. Add Request Headers (if needed):
If your API requires specific headers, you can add them in the Headers tab. Common headers include Content-Type and Authorization. 
6. Set Request Body (if needed):
If you are testing a POST or PUT request and your API expects a request body (e.g., for creating or updating resources), go to the "Body" tab and add the required data in JSON format.
7. Send the Request:
Click the "Send" button to send the request to your Spring Boot application. 8. Inspect the Response: Postman will display the response, including the status code, headers, and body.
Example:
Let's consider a simple example where you want to test a GET request to retrieve a list of users. Request Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:8080/users After sending the request, Postman will display the response from your Spring Boot application.
